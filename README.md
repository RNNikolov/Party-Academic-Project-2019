# Party-Academic-Project-2019

This is my second academic project that I made for my second semester. The task was to make a simple social network without all the network communication. I created profiles, a Binary Search Tree for storage and a recursively define traversal method to read the profiles and output them to console. All code has been commented following the university commmenting standard.
